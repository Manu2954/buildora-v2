# Logo Files Required

Please add the following logo files to the `/public` directory:

## Required Files:

1. **buildora-icon.png** (or .svg)

   - Brand icon/symbol only
   - Recommended size: 120x120px minimum
   - Used in navbar at ~40px height (desktop), ~32px (mobile)
   - Should be square or proportional
   - Transparent background recommended

2. **buildora-logo.png** (or .svg)
   - Full brand wordmark/logotype
   - Recommended size: 300x80px minimum
   - Used in navbar at ~32px height (desktop), ~24px (mobile)
   - Should include company name text
   - Transparent background recommended

## Current Implementation:

- Both images are non-draggable for better UX
- Responsive sizing across all devices
- Clickable area links to homepage
- Proper alt text for accessibility

## Fallback:

If logo files are not available, the navbar will show broken image icons. You can temporarily use any PNG/SVG files with these names for testing.
